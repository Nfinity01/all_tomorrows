	<h1>ALL TOMORROWS</h1>

 <h3>STORY EVENTS</h3>
  <p>Following the colonization of Mars, a brief but catastrophic civil war takes place between Mars and Earth. A large-scale colonization initiative is carried out by genetically-engineered humans throughout the the galaxy. Humans then encounter a malevolent and superior alien race called the Qu.<br>
<br>
The Qu's religion motivates them to remake the universe through genetic engineering. A short war follows in which humanity is defeated. The Qu bioengineer the surviving humans as punishment into a range of exotic forms, many of them unintelligent. They are left to evolve on their own as the Qu leave the galaxy. The bioengineered humans range from worm-like humans to insectivores and modular and cell-based species. The book follows the progress of these new humans as they either go extinct or regain sentience in wildly different forms and gradually discover that the Qu experimented on them.<br>
<br>
One race eventually replaces their ilating most life within it, including the other post-human species. They are, themselves, destroyed by the Asteromorphs, the descendants of the human species who escaped experimentation by the Qu. The final chapters of the book detail humanity's rebound as a post-human bodies with mechanical forms. They now call themselves the Gravitals. The Gravital colonize the rest of the galaxy, while annihalating species, and their first contact with another galaxy's life, rediscovering and defeating the Qu, and concluding with the rediscovery of Earth.<br>
<br>
All Tomorrows ends with a picture of the alien author of the book, holding a billion year old human skull and writing that all human species disappeared a billion years ago, for unknown reasons. The author goes on to state that mankind's story was always about the lives of humans themselves, not major wars and abstract ideals. The author ends by encouraging the reader to "Love Today, and seize All Tomorrows!"</p>
